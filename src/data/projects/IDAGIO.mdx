## 01 Overview

-- In this senior experience design project, we were tasked with framing a design problem and delivering an experience design solution. After research, exploration, and design sprint, the final solution took form as a browser extension for classical music discovery.

## 02 About iDAGIO

-- _iDAGIO_ is a streaming service developed specifically for classical music. By providing an extensive library and methods of discovering new music within it, IDAGIO intends to establish itself as “the [_digital_] home for classical music", in order to secure its future.

<!-- ##### Servicing the aficionado

-> It’s no question that the core audience of IDAGIO are classical music die hard fans. From their niche library to the unique comparison, it is crafted for the tough demand of classical music audience in mind. -->

---

## 03 Why do we focus on music discovery

-- IDAGIO's indecisiveness in targeting an audience has created a fragmented experience between aficionados and newcomers.

##### A tale of two experiences

-> While the mood-ring is appreciated for the genre's newcomers, preliminary research suggested that aficionados tend to find the interaction "gimmicky" as it lacks nuance, and don't find much use out of it.

-> Given newcomers and aficionados, both experience a diminishing return of enjoyment for repeated listening (research), we believed that it will be a very fruitful place to explore and seek alternatives.

## 04 Investigation and Insight

-- We took a step back and ask: _how do people actually discover new classical music?_ Through our survey, forum browsing, interview with classical music aficionados, and literary review, we surfaced the following insights:

<ListLayout full label="Insights">
  <ListItem heading="Discovery generally happens socially, outside of streaming app">
    In our literary review, we found previous academic studies on the subject of
    music streaming and discovery agreed that listeners are more likely to
    discover music through social interaction (eg. friend's/opinion leader's
    recommendation) rather than an in-app suggestion. Our survey supports the
    idea, at least 50% more respondents indicated that they discover music
    through other online means(blogs, websites) compare to music streaming
    services.
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem heading="Listeners don’t trust generated playlist, they trust human">
    Multiple interviewees have mentioned that algorithmically generated playlist
    is off-putting because the system doesn’t understand the genre and their
    taste well enough, unlike their peers in forums.
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem heading="No current solution for saving interesting discovery">
    Multiple interviewees have reported that they often have to hunt down the
    music again after their initial encounter, or worse, the discovery being
    lost forever.
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem heading="Repeated exposure develops preference to new music">
    New music is not necessarily love at first sight, preference develops over
    time as they familiarise with the sound. Especially when the user is new to
    the genre. (Reference article)
  </ListItem>
</ListLayout>

## 05 Discussion Based Discovery — Framing and Reframing

> "it’s (classical music) about opinions. It’s about being right, everybody is right. Everybody knows everything, it’s very controversially, very ego driven also."
> — Till Janczukowicz, Founder & CEO of iDAGIO

From our insights, we notice the theme of hearing other people's voices and opinions being an integral part of the classical genre and music discovery. That made us wonder how can we leverage these voices to create a new method of discovery.

The idea of an IDAGIO powered, community-driven discovery space was subsequently explored. It was intended to bring aficionados and newcomers together and facilitate music discovery through discussion.

However, we soon notice there is a problem with this idea: we are competing with Reddit and other classical music forums which already have a well-established audience base. **It will be a tremendous task to ask the dedicated users to switch over.**

-- _This realisation led us to the pivot_ — Rather than asking listeners to come to iDAGIO, we should _reach them at their established venue of discovery._ By providing tools that assist the exploration of online resources, we support listeners where they are comfortable, and establish IDAGIO as the go-to tool for discovering classical music.

---

## 06 Sprint to the solution

-- We then conducted a 2 weeks sprint to validate and refine our idea prototype. I was responsible for prototyping and user testing. The outcome was iDAGIO discovery — a three-part intervention of _embed player_, _browser extension_, and _re-cap_.

---

#### Embed Player

The Embed is the first step in bringing IDAGIO toward online forums or messaging services. If we intend for listeners to share IDAGIO links, we believe the embed is an important, first-impression touchpoint which should reflect the visual identity of the brand and its values clearly. Because of that, we've built the IDAGIO embed from the ground up to gear it specifically for classical music.

#### Extension: Highlights & Sidebar

Recognised music is linked through IDAGIO's service, allowing listeners to mark pieces to revisit later,
save pieces to personal collections, or search IDAGIO's entire library.

---

#### Extension: Link Menu

The Link Menu allows for seamless, rapid generation of hyperlinks to IDAGIO's music library. Listeners may find the music they wish to link immediately by typing its name, or locate music by narrowing results. Controlled entirely by keyboard interactions, the Link Menu brings IDAGIO's extensive library to a listener's fingertips.

#### Discovery Recap

The Discovery Recap presents listeners with an overview of all the music they have explored on various online resources through IDAGIO embeds, links, or extension-created interactions.

<FullImage noPadding src="https://www.sfu.ca/~kkl64/videos/idagio/recap.mp4" />

-> By doing so, it gives listeners a reason to create an IDAGIO account and more comfortably make use of their service.

## 07 Encourage subscription through pre-purchase value delivery

-- Through the _embed player_ and _browser extension_, iDAGIO engages its potential user in the awareness and consideration phase of the customer journey. These helpful, non-intrusive touchpoints build a positive relationship with listeners, increasing their trust and, subsequently, the likelihood of subscription to the service.

<ListLayout full label="Value Proposition">
  <ListItem heading="For Aficionado">
    Quick and easy access to iDAGIO library, which facilitates their online
    forum discussion.
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem heading="For New Comer">
    The extension provides the contextual sound reference to online
    conversations, which help following the curious newcomers navigate the
    genre.
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem heading="For iDAGIO">
    The free service acts as a venue for usage data collection to improve in-app
    recommendation algorithms. It also establishes an expert presence in an
    online forum, expanding its target audience.
  </ListItem>
</ListLayout>

## 08 Reflection

-- Because of the limited time and resources, the solution was only evaluated based on participants' self-reports under a controlled environment. To fully evaluate it in the field, we need to build out the extension and gather usage data over time in a beta test.
