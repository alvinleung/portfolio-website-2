## 01 Overview

-- In this senior experience design project, we are tasked with framing a problem and deliver an experience design solution for a client we choose. After research, exploration and design sprint, the final solution took form as a browser extension for classical music discovery.

## 02 About iDAGIO

-- _iDAGIO_ is a streaming service developed specifically for classical music. By providing an extensive library and methods of discovering new music within it, IDAGIO intends to establish itself as “the [_digital_] home for classical music", in order to secure its future.

<!-- ##### Servicing the aficionado

-> It’s no question that the core audience of IDAGIO are classical music die hard fans. From their niche library to the unique comparison, it is crafted for the tough demand of classical music audience in mind. -->

---

## 03 Why do we focus on music discovery

-- IDAGIO's indecisiveness in targeting an audience, has created a fragmented experience between aficionado and new comer.

<FullImage src="/img/idagio/discovery-problem.webp" alt="discovery problem" />

##### A tale of two experiences

-> While the mood-ring is appreciated for the genre's new comers, preliminary research suggested that aficionado tend to find the interaction "gimmicky" as it lack nuance, and don't find much use out of it.

-> Given new comers and aficionado both experience diminishing return of enjoyment for repeated listen (research), we believed that it will be very fruitful place to explore and seek alternatives.

## 04 Investigation and Insight

-- We took a step back and ask: _how do people actually discover new classical music?_ Through our own survey, forum browsing, interview with classical music aficionados and literary review, we surfaced the following insights:

<ListLayout full label="Insights">
  <ListItem heading="Discovery generally happens socially, outside of streaming app">
    In our literary review, we found previous academic studies on the subject of
    music streaming and discovery agreed that listeners are more likely to
    discover music through social interaction (eg. friend's/opinion leader's
    recommendation) rather than in app suggestion. Our survey support the idea,
    at least 50% more respondants indicated that they discover music through
    other online means(blog, websites) compare to music streaming services.
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem heading="Listeners don’t trust generated playlist, they trust human">
    Multiple interviewee have mentioned that algorithmically generated playlist
    is off-putting because the system don’t understand the genre and their taste
    well enough, unlike their peers in forums.
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem heading="No current solution for saving interesting discovery">
    Multiple interviewee have reported that they often have to hunt down the
    music again after their initial encounter, or worse, the discovery being
    lost forever.
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem heading="Repeated exposure develops preference to new music">
    New music is not necessarily love at first sight, preference develops over
    time as they familiarise with the sound. Especially when the user is new to
    the genre. (Reference article)
  </ListItem>

## 05 Discussion Based Discovery — Framing and Reframing

> "it’s (classical music) about opinions. It’s about being right, everybody is right. Everybody knows everything, it’s very controversially, very ego driven also."
> — Till Janczukowicz, Founder & CEO of iDAGIO

From our insights, we notice the theme of hearing other people's voices and opinions being an integral part to the classical genre and music discovery. That made us wonder how can we leverage these voices to create a new method of discovery.

The idea of an IDAGIO powered, community-driven discovery was subsequently explored. It intended to bring aficionado and new comer together and facilitate music their discovery through community discussion.

However, we soon notice there is a problem with this idea: we are competing with reddit and other classical music forum who already have a well established audience
base, **it will be a tremendous task to ask the dedicated users to switch over**.

-- _This realisation led us to the pivot_ — Rather than asking listeners to come to iDAGIO, we should _reach them at their established venue of discovery._ By providing tools which assist the exploration of online resources, we support listeners where they are comfortable, and establish IDAGIO as the go-to tool for discovering classical music.

---

## 06 Sprint to the solution

-- We then conducted a 2 weeks sprint to validate and refine our idea prototype. I was responsible for prototyping and user testing. The outcome was iDAGIO discovery — a three part intervention of _embed player_, _browser extension_, and _re-cap_.

#### Embed Player

The Embed is the first step in bringing IDAGIO toward online forums or messaging services. If we intend for listeners to share IDAGIO links, we believe the embed is an important, first-impression touchpoint which should reflect the visual identity of the brand and its values clearly. Because of that, we've built the IDAGIO embed from the ground up to gear it specifically for classical music.

#### Extension: Highlights & Sidebar

Recognised music is linked through IDAGIO's service, allowing listeners to mark pieces to revisit later,
save pieces to personal collections, or search IDAGIO's entire library.

<HalfImage noPadding src="/img/idagio/intruisiveness.webp" />

##### Intruisiveness

In testing the automatic highlight feature of our proposed extension, we discovered that marking text too obviously was intrusive to our testers' reading experience, and that marking too subtly made the feature unnoticeable. Once this insight was discovered, a sweet spot between invisible and intrusive became a goal for our extension.

---

#### Extension: Link Menu

The Link Menu allows for seamless, rapid generation of hyperlinks to IDAGIO's music library. Listeners may find the music they wish to link immediately by typing its name, or locate music by narrowing results. Controlled entirely by keyboard interactions, the Link Menu brings IDAGIO's extensive library to a listener's fingertips.

#### Discovery Recap

The Discovery Recap presents listeners with an overview of all the music they have explored on various online resources through IDAGIO embeds, links, or extension-created interactions.

<FullImage noPadding src="https://www.sfu.ca/~kkl64/videos/idagio/recap.mp4" />

-> By doing so, it gives listeners a reason to create an IDAGIO account and more comfortably make use of their service.

## 07 Encourage subscription through pre-purchase value delivery

-- Through a the _embed player_ and _browser extension_, iDAGIO engage their potential user in the awareness and consideration phase of the customer journey. These helpful, non-intrusive touchpoints build positive relationship with listeners, increasing their trust and, subsequently, the likelihood of subscription to the service.
