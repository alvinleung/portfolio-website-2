## 02 Concept

### Instead of utilising symbolism of music notation or flute, the logo features an approachable illustration of the teacher herself, evoking a more intimate and personal feeling.

## 03 Process and Exploration

### We started the project collaboration by exporating options which connotate with "prestigous/classy" quality of the classical music genere, but after a feedback session, I realise approach is not something the client looking for.

-> However, Sabrina wanted the brand image to be more down to earth, as she was offering tailored/sincere music education to students/family. The service is fueled by genuine passion toward the craft of flute playing instead of purely prestigous and awards.

-- With the new understanding of the client situation. I devise a new direction for the logo which explores the idea of a cute illustration evoke a sense of friendliness.
