## 02 Key Contributions

-- Including visual design, usability and user flow, here are the major pieces which helped drive the project forward.

- Experience Design
  - Managing and deveolping user interface for complex use cases.
- Interaction Pattern
  - Based on identified use case, I bring fourth the idea of utilising the timeline as a visual way to unify the working experience. I also suggested the use of temporary popup cards in the home screen for quick access.
- Design System
  - Working with other teammates, I help the development and maintenance of the an iOS inspired design system as the app concept grows, balancing consistency with efficiency, ensuring it is logic and visuals are coherent.
- Illustration & Motion Design
  - I used Adobe Illustrator to create a set of illustration for onboarding and special screens which was bring out the friendly and welcoming tone that we tried to strike. Animated splash screen was

## 03 Initial Prompt

-- We were tasked with finding a topic based on a selection of area of interest. With a little bit looking around on the internet, the team settled on Shared Economy as we think that would provide us unique yet practical UI design challenges to improve our skills.

---

## 04 The problem space

-- How can we leverage the concept of sharing economy to provide better help for the people inside the local community?

For some demographics, such as people with disabilities and seniors, household chores can be an incredible burden. However, they or their loved ones may not have the money to hire a professional and/or feel hesitant about inviting a stranger into their home.

Our solution HelpMate is a community-based task finding application that allows the users to help their community members with household chores. The app provides an easy way for young people to connect with their communities while simultaneously earning some money or volunteer hours to put towards their education.

## 06 Competitive Analysis

-- With our emphasis on the social relationship, HelpMate fill the void between Craiglist and Taskrabbit.

Existing solutions like Craiglist allows more causal exchange, but it does not provide enough reliability and security for it's user. While taskrabbit, which aimed at professional/semi professional tasker, might exclude individuals who couldn't be as committed and experienced.

## 07 Design Principles

## 08 User Testing and Fixes

-- The prototype was tested on 5 participants. The insight was then feed back into the design process.

-> The uncovered issues was systematically categorised using an affinity diagram and dot voting. By doing so we methodically turn these insights into actionable design items, successfully incorporating the user feedbacks into the final design.

#### Interaction of the check-In cards

<ComparisonView>
  <ComparisonItem src="/img/helpmate/usability-card-after.jpg" label="After" />
  <ComparisonItem
    src="/img/helpmate/usability-card-before.jpg"
    label="Before"
  />
</ComparisonView>

Problem: Users were confused on how to get to the Check-In or Task Details screens from the Check-In card, as tapping on the card itself led to one screen but tapping the Check-In button itself led to another.

-> Fix: Removed the Check-In button and so that the user will only have one interaction when tapping the card, minimizing confusion.

#### Accept/decline options might get buried in chat

<ComparisonView>

  />
  <ComparisonItem
    src="/img/helpmate/usability-accept-task-before.jpg"
    label="Before"
  />
</ComparisonView>

Problem: Users were concerned about the accept/decline options being buried in the chat if there are a lot of messages.

-> Fix: Moved the task request to a sticky header at the top of the chat, rather than as a message.
