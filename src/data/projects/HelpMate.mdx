## 01 Project Context

-- In a senior interface design course at Simon Fraser University, our team designed, prototyped, tested and pitched an App idea to the class in 7 weeks.

## 02 Key Contributions

-- Here are the major pieces that helped driving the project forward.

##### UI Interaction Pattern

-> Based on identified use case, I bring fourth the idea of utilising timeline as a visual way to unify the working experience leading to a better mental model. With consideration of the user journey, I also suggested the use of temporary popup cards in the home screen for quick access. Which interaction pattern is also used in the messaging UI for consistency.

##### Design System

-> Working with my teammates, I help the development and maintenance of the an design system (taking inspiration from apple human interface guidelines and material design) as the app concept grows, balancing consistency with efficiency, ensuring its logic and visuals are coherent .

##### Illustration & Motion Design

-> I used Adobe Illustrator to create a set of illustration for onboarding and special screens. They were intended to create a friendly and welcoming tone.

## 03 Initial Prompt

-- We were assigned to find a topic based on a selection of area of interest. With a little bit looking around on the internet, the team settled on Shared Economy as we think that would provide us unique yet practical UI design challenges to improve our skills.

---

## 04 The problem space

-- How can we leverage the concept of sharing economy to provide better help for the people within their local community?

For some demographics, such as people with disabilities and seniors, household chores can be an incredible burden. However, they or their loved ones may not have the money to hire a professional and/or feel hesitant about inviting a stranger into their home.

Our solution HelpMate is a community-based task finding application that allows the users to help their community members with household chores. The app provides an easy way for young people to connect with their communities while simultaneously earning some money or volunteer hours to put towards their education.

## 06 Competitive Analysis

-- With its emphasis on the social relationship, HelpMate fill the void between Craiglist and Taskrabbit.

Existing solutions like Craiglist allows more causal exchange, but it does not provide enough reliability and security for it's user. While taskrabbit, which aimed at professional/semi professional tasker, might exclude helpers who couldn't be as committed and experienced.

## 07 Design Principles

-- A set of Design principles was established to guide our design process.

---

## 08 User Testing and Fixes

-- The prototype was tested on 5 participants. The collected insights were then feed back into the design process.

<!-- ![painpoints classifications](../img/helpmate/usability-classification.png) -->

<FullImage

  alt="usability issue classificiation"

-> The uncovered issues was systematically categorised using an affinity diagram and dot voting. By doing so we methodically turn these insights into actionable design items, successfully incorporating the user feedbacks into the final design.

#### Update: Interaction of the check-In cards

<ComparisonView>
  <ComparisonItem src="/img/helpmate/usability-card-after.jpg" label="After" />
  <ComparisonItem
    src="/img/helpmate/usability-card-before.jpg"
    label="Before"
  />
</ComparisonView>

Problem: Users were confused on how to get to the Check-In or Task Details screens from the Check-In card, as tapping on the card itself led to one screen but tapping the Check-In button itself led to another.

-> Fix: Removed the Check-In button and so that the user will only have one interaction when tapping the card, minimizing confusion.

---

#### Update: Accept/decline options might get buried in chat

<ComparisonView>
  <ComparisonItem
    src="/img/helpmate/usability-accept-task-after.jpg"
    label="After"
  />
  <ComparisonItem
    src="/img/helpmate/usability-accept-task-before.jpg"
    label="Before"
  />
</ComparisonView>

Problem: Users were concerned about the accept/decline options being buried in the chat if there are a lot of messages.

-> Fix: Moved the task request to a sticky header at the top of the chat, rather than as a message.

---

#### Update: Use case for the check-in feature

<FullImage
  src="/img/helpmate/usability-check-in-card.jpg"
  alt="Check in card update"
  noPadding
/>

Problem: The check-in progress may be unnecessary and cumbersome for the Helper in scenarios where the Client is present during the Task, and they would be able to communicate in person more easily than in the app.

-> Fix: Added an option in the confirmation screen after accepting a task, to allow Clients to indicate whether they want this check-in updates or not.

_Note: These are few of the major fixes, this presentation slide deck provide detail breakdown and solutions of all the issues we found._
