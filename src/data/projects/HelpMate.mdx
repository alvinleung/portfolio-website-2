## 01 Overview

-- In a senior interface design course at Simon Fraser University, our team designed, prototyped, tested and pitched an App idea to the class in 7 weeks.

## 03 Initial Prompt

-- We were assigned to find a topic based on a selection of area of interest. With a little bit looking around on the internet, the team settled on Shared Economy as we think that would provide us unique yet practical UI design challenges to improve our skills.

---

## 04 The problem space

-- How can we leverage the concept of sharing economy to provide better help for the people within their local community?

For some demographics, such as people with disabilities and seniors, household chores can be an incredible burden. However, they or their loved ones may not have the money to hire a professional and/or feel hesitant about inviting a stranger into their home.

Our solution HelpMate is a community-based task finding application that allows the users to help their community members with household chores. The app provides an easy way for young people to connect with their communities while simultaneously earning some money or volunteer hours to put towards their education.

## 06 Competitive Analysis

-- With its emphasis on the social relationship, HelpMate fill the void between Craiglist and Taskrabbit.

From our research, we found that existing solutions like Craiglist allows more causal exchange, but it does not provide enough reliability and security for it's user. While taskrabbit, which aimed at professional/semi professional tasker, might exclude helpers who couldn't be as committed and experienced.

## 08 Features Overview

--

#### Reschedule Appointment

If the original appointment time conflicts with other commitments, the Helper or Client can request to reschedule the appointment. The rescheduled time needs to be confirmed by both parties before it becomes official.

  alt="Reschedule Appointment Feature"
  noPadding
/>

---

#### Cancel Appointment

Cancellations don’t need a confirmation from the other party, but a cancellation within 24 hours of the originally scheduled appointment will result in a slight penalty to a Helper or Client’s rating.

  alt="Cancel Appointment Feature"
  noPadding
/>

---

#### Appeal Cancellations

Users can avoid the cancellation penalty to their rating if they have documentation of their emergency. By having an appeal process, we can prevent one user from taking advantage of another user, but still allow for penalties to be waived for legitimate cancellations.

  alt="Appeal Cancellations Feature"
  noPadding
/>

---

#### Urgent Tasks

Clients who have a Helper cancel their task can choose to re-list their task. The re-listed task will automatically be tagged as an urgent task on the Taskboard, giving the Client a better chance of finding a Helper within the timeframe they originally posted the task for.

  alt="Urgent Tasks Feature"
  noPadding

---

#### User Identity Verification

Users are prompted to provide ID verification after they sign up, to ensure the safety of the HelpMate community. While the verification is in process, users will be able to browse the app but will not be able to see details like specific tasks.

## 09 Usability Testing and Fixes

-- The prototype was tested on 5 participants. The collected insights were then feed back into the design process.

<!-- ![painpoints classifications](../img/helpmate/usability-classification.png) -->

<FullImage
  src="/img/helpmate/usability-issue-classification.png"
  alt="usability issue classificiation"
/>

-> The uncovered issues was systematically categorised using an affinity diagram and dot voting. By doing so we methodically turn these insights into actionable design items, successfully incorporating the user feedbacks into the final design.

---

#### Update: Interaction of the check-In cards

<ComparisonView>
  <ComparisonItem src="/img/helpmate/usability-card-after.jpg" label="After" />
  <ComparisonItem
    src="/img/helpmate/usability-card-before.jpg"
    label="Before"
  />
</ComparisonView>

**Problem**: Users were confused on how to get to the Check-In or Task Details screens from the Check-In card, as tapping on the card itself led to one screen but tapping the Check-In button itself led to another.

-> **Fix**: Removed the Check-In button and so that the user will only have one interaction when tapping the card, minimizing confusion.

---

#### Update: Accept/decline options might get buried in chat

<ComparisonView>
  <ComparisonItem
    src="/img/helpmate/usability-accept-task-after.jpg"
    label="After"
  />
  <ComparisonItem
    src="/img/helpmate/usability-accept-task-before.jpg"
    label="Before"
  />
</ComparisonView>

**Problem**: Users were concerned about the accept/decline options being buried in the chat if there are a lot of messages.

-> **Fix**: Moved the task request to a sticky header at the top of the chat, rather than as a message.

---

#### Update: Use case for the check-in feature

<FullImage
  src="/img/helpmate/usability-check-in-card.jpg"
  alt="Check in card update"
  noPadding
/>

**Problem**: The check-in progress may be unnecessary and cumbersome for the Helper in scenarios where the Client is present during the Task, and they would be able to communicate in person more easily than in the app.

-> **Fix**: Added an option in the confirmation screen after accepting a task, to allow Clients to indicate whether they want this check-in updates or not.

## 10 Outcome — The Final User Flows

-- Here is a demostration of the client & helper experience.

---

#### Create a task [CLIENT]

<InterfaceDemo
  url="https://www.sfu.ca/~kkl64/videos/helpmate/1-create-task.mp4"
  noPadding
/>

-> To find help with chores, client can create a task under _My Tasks_. Task catagory and details like location, description, date, amount of helpers are customisable in the task creation modal. After the form is completed, an entry of task will be added to the community taskboard.

---

#### Find and Request for a task [HELPER]

<InterfaceDemo
  url="https://www.sfu.ca/~kkl64/videos/helpmate/2-find-task.mp4"
  noPadding
/>

-> Helpers can find a task nearby using the _Taskboard_. Tasks can be filtered out by the helper's preference. When the helper found a choice, he/she can send a request to the client under the task screen.

---

#### Receive Task Request [CLIENT]

<InterfaceDemo
  url="https://www.sfu.ca/~kkl64/videos/helpmate/3-receive-request.mp4"
  noPadding
/>

-> The client will receive a notification when a Helper send a task request. They can now chat and confirm the task details under the in app messaging system which was tailored for the scenario.

---

#### Appointment confirmation [CLIENT & HELPER]

<InterfaceDemo
  url="https://www.sfu.ca/~kkl64/videos/helpmate/4-check-in.mp4"
  noPadding
/>

-> Before the appointment, the helper will be asked to confirm the arrival time.

---

#### Check in and Payment [CLIENT & HELPER]

<InterfaceDemo
  url="https://www.sfu.ca/~kkl64/videos/helpmate/5-task-done.mp4"
  noPadding
/>

-> In order to allow clients to a peace of mind, they will be informed as the task progress status updates. Some check in feature might be opted out if the client is present during the task.

---

#### Leave a Review [CLIENT & HELPER]

<InterfaceDemo
  url="https://www.sfu.ca/~kkl64/videos/helpmate/6-review.mp4"
  noPadding
/>

-> Upon finishing the task, clients and Helpers can leave ratings and review for each other. This step is crucial for the HelpMate concept as user's peer review is the fundamental building block of safty and trust.

## 11 Reflection

### Working with these experienced teammates, this project has taught me an important lesson on the attitude of team collaboration and the importance of sharing ideas with the team.

As a “#perfectionist”, I used to have a very bad habit of holding an idea to myself and refine it before sharing it with the design team, because I was so self conscious about any criticism towards “my idea”. Through this project, I learned to put my ego aside and share unfinished work with colleagues. Couldn't say that I fully overcame this aspect of myself for now, I’ll still get upset sometimes when people say not so good things about my design. However, now I am aware of this tendency of mine when designing, I can figure out ways to deal with it and hopefully slowly I can internalise it.

Because of the scope and time constraint of the course, except usability testing, we were mostly working with our secondary research(ie. reddit, reading papers) and assumptions had to be made. We were aware that this is not ideal, however as a design exercise that focuses on the craft of creating user interfaces, I still think this is a successful project. We went through arguments and arguments from the overall direction to the finest details of button placements. The resultis a child of this amazing push and pull dynamics of the team.
