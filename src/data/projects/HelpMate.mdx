## 03 Initial Prompt

-- We were tasked with finding a topic based on a selection of area of interest. With a little bit looking around on the internet, the team settled on Shared Economy as we think that would provide us unique yet practical UI design challenges to improve our skills.

## 04 The problem space

-- How can we leverage sharing economy to provide better help for the people inside the local community?

For some demographics, such as people with disabilities and seniors, household chores can be an incredible burden. However, they or their loved ones may not have the money to hire a professional and/or feel hesitant about inviting a stranger into their home.

Our solution HelpMate is a community-based task finding application that allows the users to help their community members with household chores. The app provides an easy way for young people to connect with their communities while simultaneously earning some money or volunteer hours to put towards their education.

## 05 Competitive Analysis

Looking at the market right now, current existing solution like Craiglist allow more causal exchange, accommodating the target audience need, yet it does not provide enough reliability and security for it's user. Whereas taskrabbit which aimed at professional/semi professional tasker might exclude individuals who couldn't be as committed and experienced. Our App concept sit nicely between them, helping these part time tasker to find opportunities within their community.

## 08 User Testing

-- A Usability study was conducted on the prototype.

<!-- ![painpoints classifications](../img/helpmate/usability-classification.png) -->

The uncovered issues was systematically categorised using an affinity diagram and dot voting. By doing so we methodically turn these insights into actionable design items, successfully incorporating the user feedbacks into the final design.
