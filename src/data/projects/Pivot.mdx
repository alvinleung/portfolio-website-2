## 03 Motivation for rebrand

-- For the past 3 years, [Pivot](https://pivot.caseit.org) has been positioning itself as a local alternative to the CaseIT, a reputable international case competition hosted by the same organising committee at Simon Fraser University(SFU). With the success of last year, the team decided to further expend out of SFU and engage all aspiring business student in BC lower mainland. Because of this, the decided to search for a new visual identity to reflect the change.

## 04 Audience Research & Insight

-- To gain better understanding of the audience, we started the project by organising 70 participant applications of previous year utilising Affinity Diagram. Working with the Pivot project manager, we consolidated a persona which become the main driver of the project.

<!-- Among the responses we found the following insights captured our imagination. -->

-> Informed by this insight, our team brainstormed a few initial approaches for the art direction and pitch them to the Pivot project manager. With some back and fourth exchanges, we decided to move on by focusing on the idea innovation, youthfulness and change.

## 05 Art Direction

-- For young and ambitious future business leader, this approach celebrates the potential of their fresh perspectives and capabilities by exploring distorted visuals, breaking away from traditional corporate minimalist aesthetic.

##### Vibrant Disruption

-> _Cropping_, _motion blur in images_ and _onion skin effect_ creates an _implied movement_ which captures the fast-paced and constantly changing quality of the competition.

-> _Glitchy distortion_, _abrupt cut of letterforms_ capture the energy of their desruptive potential in the industry, while _positive connotation of vibrant colours_ reframe the meaning of the broken visuals, ensuring the approach’s affirmative tone.

<FullImage src="/img/pivot/ad-font.jpg" alt="Art direction typography" />

##### Typography

-> To represent the technology focused competition, the approach utilise medium and bold variants of the IBM plex sans family (depending of scale) as it primary font because of the distinctive mechanical appearance created by it’s emphasis on sharp angles and grotesque inspired boxy letter form.

## 08 Learning from Previous Mistakes

-- Coming into the website project, I carried a few lessons from previous experience of building a website for the same organisation. With these lessons in mind, I adjusted my approach to the design/development process.

<ListLayout noPadding label="My Learnings">
  <ListItem>
    In a student multidisciplinary team, there will be times that you have to
    take the initiative to advocate and lead a more design oriented approach. As
    they might not have the experience of working with designers.
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem>
    The problem of skipping steps in the truncated design/development process
    will risk a disorganised, unnecessarily complicated website information
    architecture.
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem>
    Loose collaboration between copywriter will lead to bland and fluffy
    content. Have to involve everyone as soon as possible and make sure provide
    the member enough (but not too much) context to work with.
  </ListItem>
</ListLayout>

## 09 The User Journey

-- With the help of an expanded team, I decided to map out the user journey. This allow the team to have a shared understanding of the user scenario, identifying opportunities in design and strategising the copy.

  caption={`After mapping out the user journey, we address each opportunities with a "how might we" question to prompt our next step.`}
/>

<ListLayout noPadding label="User Journey Insight Highlights" full>
  <ListItem heading="State of incoming visitors">
    Coming from instagram link, visitors already show certain level of interest
    when they arrive the website. HMW provide appropriate content at that stage
    so that Alex can see the value of pivot and his concerns will be addressed?
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem heading="Visitors might not have a Team">
    As a team based competition, competitors are required to form a team either
    by themselves or through the team forming facebook group. HMW integrate that
    into the overall user journey?
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem heading="Pain Point: Re-visiting Website for Signup">
    Users will have to return to the website for signing up because a) they have
    to move to desktop to upload resume and, b) some of them need to contact
    friends to assemble a team before coming back again to sign up. With the
    registration tool already decided (we can't redesign the form), HMW ustilise
    ui design to alleviate this pain point in the website?
  </ListItem>
</ListLayout>

## 10 Content Planning

-- To ensure the copy is impactful and tailored to specific audience persona, this
time, I facilitated remote sticky note session with the team copywriters and designers.
We devised a content strategy base on the identified persona.

<ListLayout noPadding label="Content Strategy">
  <ListItem>
    <em>Growth</em> is what attracts competitors to Pivot — put emphasis on the
    professional grwoth opportunitites.
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem>
    <em>Credibility</em> is what makes competitors choose Pivot (rather than its
    competitors) — Utilise
  </ListItem>

## 12 Into the code

-- Because of the tight turnaround time, I was heavily involved in the development of the website on top of my design duties.

I use ReactJS
