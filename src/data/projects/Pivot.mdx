## 03 Motivation for rebrand

-- For the past 3 years, [Pivot](https://pivot.caseit.org) has been positioning itself as a local alternative to the reputable international case competition CaseIT (hosted by the same organising committee) at Simon Fraser University(SFU). With the success of last year, the team decided to further expend out of SFU and engage all aspiring business student in BC lower mainland.

## 04 Audience Research & Insight

-- To gain better understanding of the audience, we started the project by organising 70 participant applications of previous year utilising Affinity Diagram. Among the responses we found the following insights captured our imagination.

-> Informed by this initial insight, our team brainstormed a few initial approaches for the art direction and pitch them to the Pivot project manager. With some back and fourth exchanges, we decided to move on by focusing on the idea innovation, youthfulness and change.
