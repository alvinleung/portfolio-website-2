## 03 Motivation for rebrand

-- For the past 3 years, [Pivot](https://pivot.caseit.org) has been positioning itself as a local alternative to the CaseIT, a reputable international case competition hosted by the same organising committee at Simon Fraser University(SFU). With the success of last year, the team decided to further expend out of SFU and engage all aspiring business student in British Columbia (BC) lower mainland. Because of this, they decided to search for a new visual identity to reflect the change.

## 04 Audience Research & Insight

-- We started the project by organising 70 participant application of previous year utilising Affinity Diagram. Working with the Pivot project manager, we then consolidated a persona of the type of student who we wanted to engage.

<ListLayout noPadding full label="Major themes in participant's response">
  <ListItem heading="Real life Problem">
    Students coming back to PIVOT because they thought preivous cases are
    meaningful as it involved a real life problem.
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem heading="Industry Netwroking Opportunities">

<!-- Among the responses we found the following insights captured our imagination. -->

-> Informed by the persona and with some back and forth exchanges with the project manager, we decided to move on with the brand attribute of innovation, youthfulness and change.

## 05 Art Direction

-- For young and ambitious future business leader, this rebellious approach celebrates the potential of their fresh perspectives and capabilities by exploring distorted visuals, breaking away from traditional corporate minimalist aesthetic.

<FullImage

  alt="Art direction moodboard"
  noPadding
/>

##### Vibrant Disruption

-> _Cropping_, _motion blur in images_ and _onion skin effect_ creates an _implied movement_ which captures the fast-paced and constantly changing quality of the competition.

-> _Glitchy distortion_, _abrupt cut of letterforms_ capture the energy of their desruptive potential in the industry, while _positive connotation of vibrant colours_ reframe the meaning of the broken visuals, ensuring the approach’s affirmative tone.

<FullImage src="/img/pivot/ad-font.jpg" alt="Art direction typography" />

##### Typography

-> To represent the technology focused competition, the approach utilise medium and bold variants of the IBM plex sans family (depending of scale) as it primary font because of the distinctive mechanical appearance created by it’s emphasis on sharp angles and grotesque inspired boxy letter form.

## 08 Web Design Process: <br/> Learning from Previous Mistakes

-- Coming into the website project, I carried a few lessons from previous experience of building a website for the same organisation. With these lessons in mind, I adjusted my approach to the design/development process.

<ListLayout noPadding label="My Learnings">
  <ListItem>
    In a student multidisciplinary team, there will be times that you have to
    take the initiative to advocate and lead a more design oriented approach. As
    they might not have the experience of working with designers.
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem>
    Poor planning in a truncated design/development process will risk a
    disorganised, unnecessarily complicated website information architecture.
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem>
    UX Deliverables need to involve it's user in the creation process to be
    effective. Have to involve everyone on the team as soon as possible and make
    sure provide the member enough (but not too much) context to work with.
  </ListItem>
</ListLayout>

## 09 The User Journey

-- With the help of an expanded team, I decided to map out the user journey. This help our team to accumulate a shared understanding of the visitors' scenario, identifying opportunities in design and strategising the copy.

<FullImage
  src="/img/pivot/user-journey-alex.svg"
  caption={`After mapping out the user journey, we address each opportunities with a "how might we" question to narrow our focus and prompt our next step.`}
/>

<ListLayout noPadding label="User Journey Focus" full>
  <ListItem heading="1. State of incoming visitors">
    Coming from instagram link, visitors already show certain level of
    interest/knowledge about Pivot when they arrive the website. HMW provide
    appropriate content at that <em>learning stage</em> so that Alex can see the
    value of pivot and his concerns will be addressed?
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem heading="2. Visitors might not have a Team">
    As a team based competition, competitors are required to form a team either
    by themselves or through the team forming facebook group. HMW integrate that
    elegantly into the overall user journey?
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem heading="3. Pain Point: Re-visiting Website for Signup">
    Users will have to return to the website for signing up because a) they have
    to move to desktop to upload resume and, b) some of them need to contact
    friends to assemble a team before coming back again to sign up. With the
    registration tool already decided (we can't redesign the form), HMW utilise
    ui design to alleviate this pain point in the website?
  </ListItem>
</ListLayout>

---

## 10 Content Planning

-- <em>HMW provide appropriate content at learning stage
so that Alex can see the value of pivot and his concerns will be addressed?</em>

To ensure the copy is concise and impactful at the moment, this time, I facilitated remote sticky note session with the team copywriters and designers.
We devised a content strategy based on the research insights and the value the competition promised to provide.

<ListLayout noPadding label="Content Strategy">
  <ListItem>
    <em>Growth</em> is what attracts competitors to Pivot — put emphasis on the
    professional growth opportunitites.
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem>
    <em>Credibility</em> is what makes competitors choose Pivot (rather than its
    competitors)
  </ListItem>
</ListLayout>

## 11 Putting Everything Together: <br/> <em>The Web Experience</em>

<FullImage src="/img/pivot/web-landing.jpg" alt="landing page" />

##### Landing on the website

-> Apply CTA button on top right allow returning visitors to quickly jump right to filling in registration form, while first time visitors who would like to learn about the competition can scroll down. (Unfortunately because of time constraint, the glitching colour strips weren't able to finish before the website release)

<FullImage src="/img/pivot/web-pitch.jpg" alt="Pitch" />

##### Persona Targeted Pitch

-> Copy was crafted to put emphasis on growth opportunities and credibility of the competition.

<FullImage src="/img/pivot/web-facebook.jpg" alt="connecting to facebook" />

##### Find teams on facebook

-> At the end of the pitch, the potential competitor is prompted to form a team using the facebook group along side with the option of applying.

<InterfaceDemo url="https://www.sfu.ca/~kkl64/videos/pivot/demo-navigation.mp4" />

##### Navigation bar — Interaction Design

-> A progress indicating navigation bar will appear when the site detect the user's intetion of scrolling down. This allow the user to quickly jump to specific section (if alex want to visit the website just to double check the schedule, he can jump right to the section) without cluttering the landing screen.

-> The scroll progress indicator highlights the current user position, aiding their navigation in this relatively long scrolling page.

## 12 Development

-- I created a handoff document with detailed specification of different interface components, but because the tight turnaround time, I was ended up heavily involved in the development process as well.
