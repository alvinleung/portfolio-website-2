## 03 Motivation for rebrand

-- For the past 3 years, [Pivot](https://pivot.caseit.org) has been positioning itself as a local alternative to the CaseIT, a reputable international case competition hosted by the same organising committee at Simon Fraser University(SFU).

<!-- Among the responses we found the following insights captured our imagination. -->

-> Informed by this insight, our team brainstormed a few initial approaches for the art direction and pitch them to the Pivot project manager. With some back and fourth exchanges, we decided to move on by focusing on the idea innovation, youthfulness and change.

##### Vibrant Disruption

-> _Cropping_, _motion blur in images_ and _onion skin effect_ creates an _implied movement_ which captures the fast-paced and constantly changing quality of the competition.

-> _Glitchy distortion_, _abrupt cut of letterforms_ capture the energy of their desruptive potential in the industry, while _positive connotation of vibrant colours_ reframe the meaning of the broken visuals, ensuring the approach’s affirmative tone.

#### Typography

To represent the technology focused competition, the approach utilise medium and bold variants of the IBM plex sans family (depending of scale) as it primary font because of the distinctive mechanical appearance created by it’s emphasis on sharp angles and grotesque inspired boxy letter form.
