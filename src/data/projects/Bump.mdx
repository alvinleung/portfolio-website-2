## 02 The Challenge

-- How might we utilise realtime communication technologies created by agora to create a spontaneous online networking experience?

Unlike the usual UX project where we will start from the user scenario, this project ask our team to seek a possible use case for a a set of realtime communication and artificial intelligence technologies developed by [agora](https://www.agora.io/en/).

## 06 Learning & Reflection

-- With limited time, the team have to be agile. We have to pick the right battle, ensuring quality while knowing when to stop.

With this tight turnaround time, it is indeed a testament of our craft as designers. Without proper time for research, exploration and studies, we rely on a lot of our experience designing and prior knowledge.

While design process like this is generally not a good practice to carry around when the project has more time and resources, it's certainly very useful exercise to have as it forces you to think about and focus on the essential and make it work ASAP. At the end, I am very pleasently suprised about how much we accomplish within 24 hours.
