## 01 Overview

-- This senior art direction + interaction design project envisions an expressive post-event microsite for _what if?_ — an exhibition hosted by [Fabrica](https://www.fabrica.it/). Featuring interactive art installations from 12 international artists, the works capture daring speculations of humanity's future.

## 02 Microsite Design

-- As an online archive for the installation art pieces, the microsite intends to encapsulate the physical experience of the exhibition by creating a sense of _immersion_ for visitors.

##### 1. Priming Unique Interaction Pattern

-> The landing and introductory pages act as primers to get visitors accustomed
to our use of distortion to reveal content. As visitors click on it (or overcome a resistive scroll), they will undistort
and unveil information that contextualises Fabrica and What If?.

##### 2. Denial & Reward to Encourage Content Discovery

-> Acting as the focal point of the microsite, the exhibit selection page reveals just enough information that entices the visitor to investigate more. This is achieved by tight image cropping and the “what if” prompts.

##### 3. Individual Voices for Each Exhibit

-> Each exhibit page was given its own voice via art direction and interaction. Through the use of unique color, font pairing and custom interaction which is abstracted from the physical exhibit to elicit similar thoughts and emotions.

##### 4. Resistive Scroll as Puntuation

-> On the exhibit page, resistive scrolling connects one exhibition article to another. Working with the user expectation of scrolling on websites, it subtly draws attention to a page turn at the end of an exhibit article.

##### 5. Draw to Reveal Artist

-> Below the exhibit selection page is the artist page, which is an open space where visitors can click & drag anywhere to reveal the name and portrait of all the artists involved in the exhibition.

##### 6. Navigation: Adapting to Changing Viewing Modes

-> The navigation bar mimics the content layout. As the visitor enters an exhibit, its visual form changes to signify a different viewing mode.

##### 7. Navigation: Adapting to Changing Viewing Modes

-> Inspired by the Apple iOS cursor, the cursor snaps to the closest item to reduce precision required for interacting with a small clicking area. As the visitor hovers over the back button, it previews the main state of navigation.

## 03 Art Direction Process

-- To create a unique identity for the event, the team engaged in a deep graphic experimentation process. Taking inspiration from Ellen Lupton, Woflgang Weingart and Chris Ashworth, the process began with a thorough investigation of a set of design principles and qualities.

<FullImage src="/img/whatif/principle-and-qualities.webp" alt="Type scale" />

<FullImage src="/img/whatif/exploration.webp" alt="Exploration Sketches" />

##### Studying the Principle

-> To dig deeper, we first studied and explored our design principles by generating an exhaustive amount of sketches. _(poster 1-2, samples of my contribution)_

-> Then, by introducing content and combining different explorations of qualities and principles, these sketches began to form into varied avenues for further iteration. _(poster 3-4, samples of my contribution)_

---

#### Converging from 3 Directions

3 approaches emerged as a result of the experimentation. The approach I responsible for (digital distressing) was chosen for its cohesive use of the principles and the versatility across different media.

##### A Typographic System with Purpose

-> Once we pin down our type choice, I constructed a typographic system to ensure effortless _alignment of cap-height and baseline across multiple type sizes_, creating a clean and structured appearance by consistent vertical rhythm.

## 04 Designing Expressive Interaction

-- A process of collecting and curating an extensive list of distortion techniques, interactions, animations, navigation, and methods of implementing dynamic grids were explored; formulating into three distinct approaches to surface content through interactivity.

  <ListItem>Distortion as a way to guide visitor attention</ListItem>

  <ListItem>Playing with distortion for personal expression</ListItem>
</ListLayout>

##### Start with grouping

-> Once again, to ensure a deep lateral exploration, we started the interaction design process with precedent grouping and surfaced 3 directions that are worth pursuing.

##### Interaction & Motion Sketches

-> Alongside my teammate, I contributed experimental sketches in After Effects to figure out the visual, interaction, and motion language of distortion.

  alt="Processing Exploration"

##### Prototyping with Code

-> To test out the idea of "drawing to reveal content", I created an isolated study of the interaction on the process to give ourselves a sense of how it _feels_. This tangible artefact gave our team confidence to further pursue the idea.

---

## 05 Reflection

-- This deceptively simple project taught me the craft required to land an original form.

--

#### "Don't Design in Your Head"

Externalising thoughts through creating artefacts was proved tremendously useful in both the communication and idea generation. It is amazing to see — time and time again — how the things we made have inspired the other.

--

#### Let "the user" take the back seat

Being exposed to alternative processes of doing design that is not driven by “the user” or "the problem", this project help me both appreciate and reflect on the limits of user-centred paradigm. By abandoning some of the false constraints in the process and embracing an experimental, design-driven approach, ultimately led my team to land on a more interesting form that none of us could have foreseen.

--

#### Abstract (v.)

Admittedly, _abstraction_ is a concept that I failed to fully understand prior to this project — I mean how do you _do_ abstraction in a design process? It all makes sense now after I experienced it. It is the act of asking "what makes _this_ work?". By extracting the essence of a given subject and abstracting away the specifics, it allows space for us to fill in the blanks. This technique is particularly useful for establishing an opening for generating alternatives.
