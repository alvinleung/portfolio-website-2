## 01 Overview

-- This senior art direction + interaction design project imagines an expressive post-event microsite for the _what if?_ exhibition. Hosted by [fabrica](https://www.fabrica.it/), the event explores the infinite possibilities of our future, featuring works from 12 international artists who are at the end of their art residency.

## 02 Microsite Design

-- As an online archive for the installation art pieces, the microsite intends to encapsulate the physical experience of the exhibition by creating a sense of _immersion_ for visitors.

<ListLayout noPadding label="Content Design Approach">
  <ListItem>
    Unique identity for each exhibit through visual and intearction design
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem>Create intrigue through denial & reward</ListItem>
  <ListItem>Resistive scrolling for subtle puntuation</ListItem>
</ListLayout>

<InterfaceDemo
  url="https://www.sfu.ca/~kkl64/videos/whatif/intro.mp4"
  label="1. Priming Unique Interaction Pattern"
>
  The landing and introductory pages act as primers to get visitors accustomed
  to our use of{" "}
  <InterfaceAnnotation timecode={2} position={{ x: 300, y: 200 }}>
    distortion to reveal content
  </InterfaceAnnotation>
  . As visitors click on it (or overcome a resistive scroll), they will undistort
  and unveil information that contextualizes Fabrica and What If?
</InterfaceDemo>

<InterfaceDemo
  url="https://www.sfu.ca/~kkl64/videos/whatif/	selection-page.mp4"
  label="2. Denial & Reward to Encourage Content Discovery"
>
  Acting as the focal point of the microsite, the exhibit selection page reveals
  just enough information that entices the visitor to investigate more. This is
  achieved by{" "}
  <InterfaceAnnotation timecode={0.5} position={{ x: 960, y: 540 }}>
    tight image cropping
  </InterfaceAnnotation>{" "}
  and the{" "}
  <InterfaceAnnotation timecode={0.5} position={{ x: 1500, y: 540 }}>
    “what if” prompts
  </InterfaceAnnotation>{" "}
  .
</InterfaceDemo>

<InterfaceDemo
  url="https://www.sfu.ca/~kkl64/videos/whatif/homo-quantis.mp4"
  label="3. Individual Voices for Each Exhibit"
>
  Each exhibit page was given its own voice inspired by the piece iteself. Through the use of unique color, font pairing and custom <InterfaceAnnotation timecode={8} position={{ x: 500, y: 540 }}>interaction</InterfaceAnnotation>{" "} which is abstracted from the physical exhibit to elicit similar thoughts and emotions.

</InterfaceDemo>

<InterfaceDemo
  url="https://www.sfu.ca/~kkl64/videos/whatif/resistive-scroll.mp4"
  label="4. Resistive Scroll as Puntuation"
>

On the exhibit page, <InterfaceAnnotation timecode={6000} position={{ x: 960, y: 540 }}>resistive scrolling</InterfaceAnnotation> connects one exhibition article to another. Working with the user expectation of scrolling on websites, subtly draw attention to a page turn at the end of an exhibit article.

</InterfaceDemo>

<!-- ##### 4. Resistive Scroll

-> Carefully placed resistive scroll puntuates the content across the site. Acting as a speed bump for the scrolling in order create a more mindful reading experience. -->

<InterfaceDemo
  url="https://www.sfu.ca/~kkl64/videos/whatif/artist-page.mp4"
  label="5. Draw to Reveal Artist"
>
  Below the exhibit selection page is the artist page, which is an open space
  where visitors can click & drag anywhere to reveal the name and portrait of
  all the artists involved in the exhibition.
</InterfaceDemo>

<InterfaceDemo
  url="https://www.sfu.ca/~kkl64/videos/whatif/nav-bar-going-in.mp4"
  label="7. Navigation: Adapting to Changing Viewing Modes"
>
  The navigation bar is designed to be{" "}
  <InterfaceAnnotation timecode={1} position={{ x: 500, y: 540 }}>
    responsive
  </InterfaceAnnotation>{" "}
  to the content layout. As the visitor{" "}
  <InterfaceAnnotation timecode={10} position={{ x: 500, y: 540 }}>
    enters
  </InterfaceAnnotation>{" "}
  an exhibit, its visual form changes to signify a different viewing mode.
</InterfaceDemo>

<InterfaceDemo
  url="https://www.sfu.ca/~kkl64/videos/whatif/nav-bar-going-out.mp4"
  label="8. Navigation: Snapping Cursor & Back Button"
>
  Inspired by the Apple iOS cursor, the cursor{" "}
  <InterfaceAnnotation timecode={1} position={{ x: 500, y: 540 }}>
    snaps
  </InterfaceAnnotation>{" "}
  to the closest item to reduce precision required for interacting with a small
  clicking area. As the visitor{" "}
  <InterfaceAnnotation timecode={6.7} position={{ x: 500, y: 540 }}>
    hovers
  </InterfaceAnnotation>{" "}
  over the back button, it previews the main state of navigation.
</InterfaceDemo>

## 03 Art Direction Process

-- To create a unique identity for the event, the team engaged in a deep graphic experimentation process. Taking inspiration from Ellen Lupton, Woflgang Weingart and Chris Ashworth, the process began with a thorough investigation of a set of design principles and qualities.

<FullImage src="/img/whatif/principle-and-qualities.webp" alt="Type scale" />

<FullImage src="/img/whatif/exploration.webp" alt="Exploration Sketches" />

##### Studying the Principle

-> To dig deeper, we first studied and explored our design principles by generating an exhaustive amount of sketches. _(poster 1-2, samples of my contribution)_

-> Then, by introducing content and combining different explorations of qualities and principles, these sketches began to form into varied avenues for further iteration. _(poster 3-4, samples of my contribution)_

---

#### Converging from 3 Directions

3 approaches emerged as a result of the experimentation. The approach I responsible for (digital distressing) was chosen for its cohesive use of the principles and the versatility across different media.

##### A Typographic System with Purpose

-> Once we pin down our typographic choice, I constructed a typographic to ensure effortless _alignment of cap-height and baseline across multiple type sizes_, creating a clean and structured appearance by consistent vertical rhythm.

## 05 Designing Expressive Interaction

-- A process of collecting and curating an extensive list of distortion techniques, interactions, animations, navigation, and methods of implementing dynamic grids were explored; formulating into three distinct approaches to surface content through interactivity.

<ListLayout noPadding label="Initial Lines of Investigation">
  <ListItem>Distortion as a way to guide visitor attention</ListItem>
  <ListItem>Denial and reward through high effort interactions</ListItem>
  <ListItem>Playing with distortion for personal expression</ListItem>
</ListLayout>

<FullImage

  alt="Type scale"
/>

##### Start with grouping

-> Once again, to ensure a deep lateral exploration, we started the interaction design process with precedent grouping and surfaced 3 directions that are worth pursuing.

##### Interaction & Motion Sketches

-> Alongside my teammate, I contributed experimental sketches in After Effects to figure out the visual, interaction, and motion language of distortion.

  alt="Processing Exploration"

##### Prototyping with Code

-> To test out the idea of "drawing to reveal content", I created an isolated study of the interaction on the process to give ourselves a sense of how it _feels_. This tangible artefact gave our team confidence to further pursue the idea.

---

## 06 Reflection

-- This deceptively simple project taught me the craft required to land on an original form.

--

#### "Don't Design in Your Head"

Externalising thoughts through creating artefact was proved tremendously useful in both communication and idea generation throughout the process. It is amazing to see — time and time again — how the things we have made have inspired the other. With this experience, I realise that prototyping, image grouping, sketching or all other design techniques are all about creating artifects that help us see ideas that we wouldn't have encountered otherwise.

--

#### Let "the user" take the back seat

Being exposed to alternative processes of doing design that is not driven by “the user” or "the problem", this project help me both appreciate and reflect on the limit of user-centred paradigm. By abandoning some of the false constraints in the process and embracing an experimental, design-driven approach, ultimately led my team to land on a more interesting form that none of us could have foreseen.

--

#### Abstract (v.)

Admittedly, _abstraction_ is a concept that I failed to fully understand prior to this project — I mean how do you _do_ abstraction? Now I know this art of distilling raw materials into a clear yet open takeaway is essential to a good design process. It is useful for establishing an opening for generating alternatives. By getting rid of the specifics, it allow space for us to fill in the blanks.
