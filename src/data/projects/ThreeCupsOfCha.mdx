## 03 Process — Discovery and Ideation

### After initial exchanges with the founders, I arranged a remote photo collage co-design session to learn their style preferences. Informed by the outcome of the session, I started the process of exploring various visual forms of the logo by sketching.

##### Moodboard

-> Based on the client preferences discovered in the initial discovery session, I put together a moodboard to for ideation inspiration.

##### Final Design

-> After a feedback session with the clients, we decided to move on with concept 1. I further refined the the logo by adding a chamfer to the edges to bring more wramth the design, making it look more friendly and welcoming.

##### Logo Lockups

-> Due to the length of the client's name, it poses interesting layout challenge for a logo lockup. Three different lockups configuration was created to address the practical scaling issues, allowing the logo to adapt to different layout.
