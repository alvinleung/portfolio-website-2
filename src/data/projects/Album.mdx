## 02 Art Direction

-- Inspired by the track itself, the cover art visually explore the alluring dissonance between hypnotic, soothing sound of low-fi hip-hop beat and the weighty theme of depression with colours and textures.

##### Colour and Texture

-> The concept plays into the visual language of the low-fi hip-hop playlist aesthetic with the dreamy, pinkish tone.

-> Faint but intense red marks was intended to heighten the raw emotion in the Jackson Pollock style painting, depicting the moment of sadness piercing through the quiet night.

##### Typography

-> The grunge typography inspired type treatment is applied to complement the visceral brush strokes in the abstract painting, further amplifying the feeling of distress.
