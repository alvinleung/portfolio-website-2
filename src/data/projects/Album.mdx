##### Colour and Texture

-> The concept plays into the visual language of the low-fi hip-hop playlist aesthetic with the purple and pinkish tone.

-> Faint but intense red marks was intended to heighten the raw emotion in the expressive painting, depicting the moment of sadness piercing through the quiet night.
