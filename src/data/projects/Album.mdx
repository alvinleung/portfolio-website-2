## 02 Art Direction

-- Cover art that captures an alluring dissonance between hypnotic, soothing low-fi beats and the theme of distress through dreamy colours and expressive brush textures.

##### Colour and Texture

-> The concept plays into the visual language of the low-fi hip-hop aesthetic with purple and pinkish tone. Faint but intense red marks were intended to heighten the raw emotion in the expressive painting, depicting the moment of sadness piercing through the quiet night.

##### Typography

-> Grunge typography inspired type treatment was applied to complement the visceral brush strokes, further amplifying the feeling of distress.
