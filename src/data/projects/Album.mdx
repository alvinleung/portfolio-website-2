## 02 Art Direction

-- The cover art expressed an alluring dissonance between hypnotic, soothing low-fi beat and the weighty theme of depression through dreamy colours and visceral brush textures.

##### Colour and Texture

-> The concept plays into the visual language of the low-fi hip-hop aesthetic with the purple and pinkish tone.

-> Faint but intense red marks were intended to heighten the raw emotion in the expressive painting, depicting the moment of sadness piercing through the quiet night.

##### Typography

-> The grunge typography inspired type treatment was applied to complement the visceral brush strokes, further amplifying the feeling of distress.
